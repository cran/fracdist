\title{Calculate P-values for Fractional Unit Root and Cointegration Tests}
\usage{
fracdist_pvalues(iq, iscon, dir_name = NULL, bb, stat)
}
\arguments{
\item{iq}{An integer scalar rank parameter for the test, from 1 through 12.
This is often the difference in cointegration rank.}

\item{iscon}{An indicator that there is a constant intercept
term in the model.}

\item{dir_name}{A string name of directory in which the approximating tables
are stored. This is not normally used, since sufficient tables are included in the package.
However, a user might want to draw the tables from another location.}

\item{bb}{The fractional integration parameter, which can take on values
between 0.5 and 2.0.}

\item{stat}{A numeric scalar value of the test statistic.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar P-value.
}
\description{
\code{fracdist_pvalues} calculates P-values for a particular value of the observed
statistic.
}
\examples{
fracdist_pvalues(iq = 1, iscon = 0, bb = 0.73, stat = 3.84)
